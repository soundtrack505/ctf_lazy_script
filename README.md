# ctf_lazy_script

This is a script that automates some of the ctf process you usually do.

The script will work better when using "Terminator"... I am trying to make it work with all the terminals
it might take some time...

I dont own any of the programs in this script I only auto use them!
Please support the actually creators of the tools.


# Installation

$ lazy

use the menu
